# JFrog User Sync Script

This script is used to synchronize specified user configurations, such as group membership and permission target membership, from a source JFrog Platform instance to a destination JFrog Platform instance.

**Note:** REST API calls require JFrog Platform version >= 7.49.3.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) tool installed. You can install it using your package manager.

## Usage

```bash
./user_conf_transfer.sh <SRC_JPD_URL> <SRC_JPD_AUTH_TOKEN> <DST_JPD_URL> <DST_JPD_AUTH_TOKEN> <USER_LIST_STR> <DRY_RUN>

<SRC_JPD_URL>: URL of the source JFrog Platform instance (e.g., https://srcjpd.jfrog.io).
<SRC_JPD_AUTH_TOKEN>: Authentication token for the admin user in the source JFrog Platform instance.
<DST_JPD_URL>: URL of the destination JFrog Platform instance (e.g., https://dstjpd.jfrog.io).
<DST_JPD_AUTH_TOKEN>: Authentication token for the admin user in the destination JFrog Platform instance.
<USER_LIST_STR>: Comma-separated list of users to sync (e.g., "user1,user2,user3").
<DRY_RUN>: Specify "yes" for a dry run or "no" for a real execution.
```

## Output
The script performs the following actions:

1. Checks if the jq tool is available.
2. Defines a function to hide the Authorization token in the script's output.
3. Validates admin access on source and destination JFrog Platform endpoints.
4. Iterates through the list of users to perform the following actions for each user:
    - Checks if the user exists in the source JFrog Platform instance.
    - If the user does not exist in the destination JFrog Platform instance, it creates a new user.
    - Checks the user's group memberships and adds them to the destination if needed.
    - Checks the user's permission targets and adds them to the destination if needed.

## Example
```
./user_conf_transfer.sh https://srcjpd.jfrog.io <SRC_JPD_AUTH_TOKEN> https://dstjpd.jfrog.io <DST_JPD_AUTH_TOKEN> "user1,user2,user3" yes
```

If a user user1@xyz.com has recently been added to the groups ASD-Conan-Dev and Artifact-ASD-All in the source JFrog Platform instance (e.g., https://srcjpd.jfrog.io) then DRY_RUN shows the curl commands that will be run as below on the target  JFrog Platform instance.

Then for a real execution pass value "no" for  DRY_RUN.

`Sample Output in DRY_RUN mode "yes" :`
