1. Request the customer to provide a list of repositories for synchronization during phase 1. This approach is recommended because transferring all repositories (especially if there are hundreds of them) from the source (refered to as NCR) to the target Artifactory instance ( refered to NCRAtleos) is a time-consuming process.

Customer gave us the `NCRAtleos_HighPriorityRepositories_All.08222023`.  
Sort the  NCRAtleos_HighPriorityRepositories_All.08222023 repos:
```
sort -o ncr/NCRAtleos_HighPriorityRepositories_All.08222023 ncr/NCRAtleos_HighPriorityRepositories_All.08222023
```

Verify if all repos in  NCRAtleos_HighPriorityRepositories_All.08222023 are present the source Artifactory so that it can be created in the target Artifactory.

a) Get all the repo names in source Artifactory JPD:
```
jf c use ncr
jf rt curl /api/repositories   | jq -r '.[] | .key' >> ncr/all_repositories.list
sort -o ncr/all_repositories.list ncr/all_repositories.list
```


The `comm` utility provides the `-23` option, which serves to suppress the output of lines unique to the first file (-2) and lines common to both files (-1). This results in displaying only the lines that are unique to the first file.

Additionally, it's worth noting that the `comm` utility offers the `-12` option, which suppresses the output of lines unique to FILE1 (-1) and lines unique to FILE2 (-2), retaining only the lines that are common between both files.

To check for the absence of any of these repositories in the `ncr/all_repositories.list`, I have verified that there are no repositories in the `ncr/NCRAtleos_HighPriorityRepositories_All.08222023` file that are not present in `ncr/all_repositories.list` using the following command:

```bash
comm -23 <(sort ncr/NCRAtleos_HighPriorityRepositories_All.08222023) <(sort ncr/all_repositories.list)
```

This command compares the sorted contents of the two files and returns the repositories that exist in `NCRAtleos_HighPriorityRepositories_All.08222023` but are missing in `all_repositories.list`.

---

2. Bucket the high priority repos NCRAtleos_HighPriorityRepositories_All.08222023 we got from customer 
into local, remote and virtual.

For this extract the local, remote , virtual repos from the source Artifactory as seperate lists using the following:
```
jf c use ncr
jf rt curl  -X GET "/api/repositories?type=local"  | jq -r '.[] | .key' >> ncr/all_local_repos_in_ncr.txt
sort -o ncr/all_local_repos_in_ncr.txt ncr/all_local_repos_in_ncr.txt

jf rt curl  -X GET "/api/repositories?type=remote"  | jq -r '.[] | .key' >> ncr/all_remote_repos_in_ncr.txt
sort -o ncr/all_remote_repos_in_ncr.txt ncr/all_remote_repos_in_ncr.txt

jf rt curl  -X GET "/api/repositories?type=virtual"  | jq -r '.[] | .key' >> ncr/all_virtual_repos_in_ncr.txt
sort -o ncr/all_virtual_repos_in_ncr.txt ncr/all_virtual_repos_in_ncr.txt
```

Utilize the [find_repos_in_files_and_bucket_by_type.py](find_repos_in_files_and_bucket_by_type.py) script to extract each repository name from an input file. If the repository name is found in any of the three repository type lists, which are ["all_local_repos_in_ncr.txt", "all_remote_repos_in_ncr.txt", "all_virtual_repos_in_ncr.txt"], you should categorize and store them in corresponding files named "found_in_all_local_repos_in_ncr.txt," "found_in_all_remote_repos_in_ncr.txt," and "found_in_all_virtual_repos_in_ncr.txt."

To achieve this, you can execute the following Python script:

```python
cd ncr
python find_repos_in_files_and_bucket_by_type.py NCRAtleos_HighPriorityRepositories_All.08222023 all_local_repos_in_ncr.txt all_remote_repos_in_ncr.txt all_virtual_repos_in_ncr.txt
```

So you'll need to create repositories from the following output files:

1. `ncr/found_in_all_local_repos_in_ncr.txt`
2. `ncr/found_in_all_remote_repos_in_ncr.txt`
3. `ncr/found_in_all_virtual_repos_in_ncr.txt`

---

3. Create the "local" repos in target Artifactory using the [create-repos.sh](https://github.com/shivaraman83/security-entities-migration/blob/main/create-repos.sh) script .
You can run a modified script  to create the repos from ncr/found_in_all_local_repos_in_ncr.txt in the target artifactory , NCRAtleos :
```
cd /Users/sureshv/Documents/From_Customer/ncr/jpds
source=ncr
target=ncratleostest

cat ncr/found_in_all_local_repos_in_ncr.txt.txt |  while read line
do
    REPO=$line
    echo "Getting configuration for "$REPO

        jf rt curl api/repositories/$REPO --server-id=$source >> $target/creating-1-high_local-repos/$REPO-config.json
        echo creating repo -- $REPO on $target
        data=$( jf rt curl  -X PUT api/repositories/$REPO -H "Content-Type: application/json" -T $target/creating-1-high_local-repos/$REPO-config.json --server-id=$target -s | grep message | xargs)
        echo $data
        if [[ $data == *"message"*  ]];then
          echo "$REPO" >> $target/creating-1-high_local-repos/conflicting-repos.txt
        fi
done
```

or

It can be created just using the "jf rt transfer-config-merge" .


You can use shell command to read all lines in a file and print them in a single line with a semi-colon seperator
```
semicolon_separated_list_of_repos=$(tr '\n' ';' < ncr/found_in_all_local_repos_in_ncr.txt)

jf rt transfer-config-merge ncr ncratleostest --include-repos "$semicolon_separated_list_of_repos" --include-projects ""
```

---

4. Create all required remote repos in the target Artifactory

First find out the remotes in 
```
target=ncratleostest
jf rt curl  -X GET "/api/repositories?type=remote" --server-id=$target | jq -r '.[] | .key' >> "$target/all_remote_repos_in_$target.txt"
sort -o "$target/all_remote_repos_in_$target.txt" "$target/all_remote_repos_in_$target.txt"
```

Following remote repos are yet to the created :

Now which of the repos in ncr/NCRAtleos_HighPriorityRepositories_All.08222023 that are not in ncratleos/ncr-atleos-repositories.list
```
comm -23 <(sort ncr/all_remote_repos_in_ncr.txt) <(sort "$target/all_remote_repos_in_$target.txt") 
```
You can do it using "transfer-config-merge":
```
jf rt transfer-config-merge ncr ncratleostest --include-repos "third-party-docker-aquasec-enforcer-proxy"  
```

If it  fails with:
```
06:05:58 [ðŸ”µInfo] ========== Transferring repositories ==========
06:05:58 [ðŸ”µInfo] Deactivating key encryption in Artifactory...
06:05:58 [ðŸš¨Error] server response: 405
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "status": 405,
      "message": "Cannot disable encryption for SaaS Artifactory"
    }
  ]
}
```


then, just export the repo config and import them.
```
cd /Users/sureshv/Documents/From_Customer/ncr/jpds
source=ncr
target=ncratleostest

REPO=third-party-docker-aquasec-enforcer-proxy
jf rt curl api/repositories/$REPO --server-id=$source >> $target/creating-missing-remote-repos/$REPO-config.json

You may need to fix the "password". Just to create the remote repo you can set it to `"password" : "password"` and change the password after repo creation:

jf rt curl  -X PUT api/repositories/$REPO -H "Content-Type: application/json" -T $target/creating-missing-remote-repos/$REPO-config.json --server-id=$target -s 
```
---

5. Now create the missing virtual repos in the target:

shell command to read all lines in a file and print them in a single line with a semi-colon separator
```
semicolon_separated_list_of_repos=$(tr '\n' ';' < ncr/found_in_all_virtual_repos_in_ncr.txt)
jf rt transfer-config-merge ncr ncratleostest --include-repos "$semicolon_separated_list_of_repos"  --include-projects ""
```


---
6. if customer also wants to copy the remote repos -cache to the target artifactory do the following:
Create the local "cached-*" prefix  repos for each of the remote repos
```
jf c use ncr
jf rt curl "/api/repositories?type=remote" | jq -r '.[] | .packageType'  | sort | uniq -c
```

Example:
```
   2 Bower
   2 Debian
   7 Docker
  25 Maven
   1 Npm
   5 NuGet
   1 Pypi
   1 YUM
```

Note:
The command , jf rt curl "/api/repositories?type=remote" , returns a list:
```
[ {
  "key" : "third-party-bower-herokuapp-proxy",
  "description" : " (local file cache)",
  "type" : "REMOTE",
  "url" : "https://github.com/",
  "packageType" : "Bower"
}, {
  "key" : "third-party-bower-proxy",
  "description" : "Third-Party Bower Proxy (local file cache)",
  "type" : "REMOTE",
  "url" : "https://github.com/",
  "packageType" : "Bower"
}
]
```


Ran the following command to create a generic [template.json](template.json) as mentioned in https://github.com/jfrog/SwampUp2022/tree/main/SUP016-Automate_everything_with_the_JFrog_CLI/lab-1 
```
jf rt repo-template template.json
```
Verify creation of the local "cached-*" prefix  repos using [create_cached_locals_for_all_remotes.sh](create_cached_locals_for_all_remotes.sh) with --dry-run option
```
bash ./create_cached_locals_for_all_remotes.sh ncr template.json --dry-run
```

Then create the new cached-* locals i.e without the  --dry-run:
```
bash ./create_cached_locals_for_all_remotes.sh ncr template.json
```
---

7. Next copy the content of the remote repo cache to the respective cached- repo using [copy_to_cached_locals_for_all_remotes.sh](copy_to_cached_locals_for_all_remotes.sh)
```
screen -dmS myjfsession bash -c 'export JFROG_CLI_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG;JFROG_CLI_ERROR_HANDLING=panic; ./copy_to_cached_locals_for_all_remotes.sh ncr --dry-run 2>&1 | tee /root/jf_output_1.log; exec bash'

screen -dmS myjfsession bash -c 'export JFROG_CLI_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG;JFROG_CLI_ERROR_HANDLING=panic; ./copy_to_cached_locals_for_all_remotes.sh ncr 2>&1 | tee /root/jf_output_1.log; exec bash'
```
---

8. Now get the list of cached-* repos as comma separated and create them in the target artifactory.
```
jf rt curl -X GET "/api/repositories?type=local" -s | jq -r '.[].key' | grep '^cached-' | tr '\n' ';'
jf rt transfer-config-merge --include-repos "<Semi-colon seperated list of repos>" ncr ncratleostest
```
---

9. Now start the transfer-files for the local repos from source to the target artifactory:
```
nohup sh -c 'export JFROG_CLI_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG;JFROG_CLI_ERROR_HANDLING=panic;jf rt transfer-files ncr ncratleostest --include-repos "<Semi-colon seperated list of repos>"' &

tail -F ~/nohup.out
```

10. If you have to redo the transfer-files for any of the repos you can use the "--ignore-state" option:

```
nohup sh -c 'export JFROG_CLI_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG;JFROG_CLI_ERROR_HANDLING=panic;jf rt transfer-files ncr ncratleostest --include-repos "<Semi-colon seperated list of repos>" --ignore-state' &
```

11. If you want you can setup replication between *all the local repos* in source artifactory to the corresponding repo in target using
[set-replication.sh](https://github.com/shivaraman83/convert-local-to-federated/blob/master/set-replication.sh)

or
just for  specific `"<Semi-colon seperated list of repos>"`  using [set-replication-for-given-repos.sh](set-replication-for-given-repos.sh):
```
bash -c 'export JFROG_CLI_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG;JFROG_CLI_ERROR_HANDLING=panic; bash ./set-replication-for-given-repos.sh ncr ncratleostest "<Semi-colon seperated list of repos>" --dry-run'

Then run:
bash -c 'export JFROG_CLI_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG;JFROG_CLI_ERROR_HANDLING=panic; bash ./set-replication-for-given-repos.sh ncr ncratleostest "<Semi-colon seperated list of repos>"'
```

12. After the transfer-files or the replication between the repos are done , you can  compare the  source repos to the target repos to identify if all the artifacts/files  have been copied to the target repos using [compare_repo_list_details_in_source_vs_target_rt_after_migration.py](compare_repo_list_details_in_source_vs_target_rt_after_migration.py) which generates the repo comparison summary file [comparison.txt](output/comparison.txt):
```

jf rt curl -X POST "/api/storageinfo/calculate" --server-id=ncr 
Output:
{"info":"Calculating storage summary scheduled to run successfully"}

cd /Users/sureshv/Documents/From_Customer/ncr/jpds/ncr
jf rt curl -X GET "/api/storageinfo" --server-id=ncr > ncr_storageinfo.json


jf rt curl -X POST "/api/storageinfo/calculate" --server-id=ncratleostest 
cd /Users/sureshv/Documents/From_Customer/ncr/jpds/ncratleostest
jf rt curl -X GET "/api/storageinfo" --server-id=ncratleostest > ncratleostest_storageinfo.json

python compare_repo_list_details_in_source_vs_target_rt_after_migration.py --source /Users/sureshv/Documents/From_Customer/ncr/jpds/ncr/ncr_storageinfo.json \
 --target /Users/sureshv/Documents/From_Customer/ncr/jpds/ncratleostest/ncratleostest_storageinfo.json \
  --repos /Users/sureshv/Documents/From_Customer/ncr/jpds/ncr/local_repos_other_than_cached_that_should_sync_to_ncratleostest.txt \
   --out /Users/sureshv/Documents/From_Customer/ncr/scripts/output/comparison.txt
```



13. Then for each repo you can find the diff i.e files in source repo that is not in target repo  using the convenient python script [repodiff.py](../after_migration_helper_scripts/repoDiff/repodiff.py):
that is imporvised from 
[replicationDiff.sh](https://github.com/jfrog/artifactory-scripts/blob/master/replicationDiff/replicationDiff.sh) 


```
python repodiff.py --source-artifactory ncr --target-artifactory ncratleostest --source-repo fsg-th-docker-snapshots --target-repo fsg-th-docker-snapshots
```

14. If you have to delete the artifacts in a huge repo , so you can start over the transfer-files for the repo you can use
[delete_artifacts_in_repo_in_batches.sh](delete_artifacts_in_repo_in_batches.sh) :
```
bash ./delete_artifacts_in_repo_in_batches.sh <repo_name> <total_artifacts_to_delete_in_batch> artifactory-serverid
Example:
bash ./delete_artifacts_in_repo_in_batches.sh example-repo-local 1000 ncr
```
